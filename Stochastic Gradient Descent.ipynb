    "Stochastic gradient descent (SGD or \"on-line\") typically reaches convergence much faster than batch (or \"standard\") gradient descent since it updates weight more frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the batch gradient descent which computes the gradient using the whole dataset, because the SGD, also known as incremental gradient descent, tries to find minimums or maximums by iteration from a single randomly picked training example, the error is typically noisier than in gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this can also have the advantage that stochastic gradient descent can escape shallow local minima more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to obtain accurate results with stochastic gradient descent, the data sample should be in a random order, and this is why we want to shuffle the training set for every epoch."

    "the optimization step in gradient descent function is as follows: $$\\theta_j := \\theta_j - \\alpha \\frac {\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_j}J_{\\theta}(x,y,m)$$\n",
    "This function is optimized until $\\mathbf{J_{\\theta}}$ is less than a tolerance value or the set number of iterations have been reached. In all cases, the optimization is performed on all examples in the data set, and that is why regular gradient descent is also known as batch gradient descent. The effect of this is an incremental movement towards the global minimum.\n",
    "With stochastic gradient descent however, the value for $m$ is set to 1, and in each iteration, for each element in the dataset the weights are optimized.\n",
    "The optimization step in stochastic gradient descent looks as follows: $$\\theta_j := \\theta_j - \\alpha \\frac {\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_j}J_{\\theta}(x_i,y_i)$$ where $i$ is the current element in the data set\n"

    "\n",

    "__On Convergence__\n",
    "Batch GD takes a reasonably straightforward trajectory to the optimium, but in SGD, because each iteration is trying to create a better fit to the cost function, it tends to take seemingly random/ circuitous trajectory towards the optimum. Actually, it never reaches the optimum but remains in the general neighborhood of the optimum until the algorithm is stopped. SGD never converges but it ends up falling within a location close enough that the approximation of the optimum achieved using SGD can represent the global optimum\n",

    "__Speed of 'Convergence'__\n",
    "\n",
    "With batch GD, one optimization step is taken after evaluating the cost function over all examples of the dataset. With stochastic GD, the weights are updated for each training example, and this can lead to much faster movement towards the optimum. Usually after a few iterations or epochs over the entire dataset, the optimum will have been found\n",

    "__When to use SGD__\n",
    "\n",
    "If the number of training samples are large, in fact very large, then using gradient descent may take too long because in every iteration when you are updating the values of the parameters, you are running through the complete training set. On the other hand, using SGD will be faster because you use only one training sample and it starts improving itself right away from the first sample.\n",
